                                Landscape painting is one of the most important and famous painting types in traditional
                                Chinese painting, which reflects the Chinese people's love for natural landscapes and
                                aesthetic feelings. Landscape painting pursues freehand and artistic conception, pays
                                attention to change and leave blank, and expresses the form, momentum and artistic
                                conception of landscape through pen and ink.</p>

                                Flower-and-bird painting is another important traditional painting in Chinese painting,
                                with flowers, birds and animals as the main objects of expression. Flower-and-bird
                                painting pays attention to the combination of realism and freehand, pursues both form
                                and spirit, and emphasizes the careful observation and aesthetic perception of life.</p>

                                Figure painting is another important category in the Chinese painting tradition,
                                including different forms of sketching and portrait. Figure painting emphasizes the
                                depiction of characters and the expression of emotions, and pursues the unity of
                                character form and psychological temperament.
